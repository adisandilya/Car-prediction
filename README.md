# Car-prediction
I have the car prediction project using Machine Learning Algorithms.

DATASET
The Data set can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho

Technologies Used
Python Pandas Scikit-learn Matplotlib Seaborn , Linear & Lasso Regression.

Result
Linear Regression: Predicts prices by fitting a straight line through the data, using all features. It's simple but might overfit with irrelevant features.

Lasso Regression: Also predicts prices but adds a penalty to reduce less important features' impact, leading to a simpler model that often generalizes better.
